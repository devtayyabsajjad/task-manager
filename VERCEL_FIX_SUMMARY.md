# Vercel Deployment 404 Error - Solution Summary

## Issues Identified

Based on the build logs and configuration analysis, the main issues causing the 404 error were:

1. **Incorrect Routing Configuration**: The original `vercel.json` routing wasn't properly handling SPA (Single Page Application) fallback routing for React Router.

2. **Build Configuration Mismatch**: The build configuration wasn't optimally set up for the monorepo structure with separate frontend and backend apps.

3. **Missing Environment Variables**: Frontend environment variables weren't properly configured for production.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `vercel.json` Configuration
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "apps/frontend/package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist"
      }
    },
    {
      "src": "api/index.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/index.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/apps/frontend/dist/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Simplified routing to ensure all non-API routes fall back to `index.html` for React Router
- Used `@vercel/static-build` for the frontend to properly handle the build process
- Removed complex routing patterns that were causing conflicts

### 2. Updated Frontend Configuration

**Added `vite.config.ts` improvements:**
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: '/',  // Added explicit base path
  // ... rest of config
});
```

**Created `.env.production` for frontend:**
```env
VITE_API_URL=/api
VITE_API_REGISTER=/api/auth/register
VITE_API_LOGIN=/api/auth/login
# ... other API endpoints
```

**Added `vercel-build` script to frontend `package.json`:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "vercel-build": "vite build"
  }
}
```

### 3. Added SPA Support Files

**Created `apps/frontend/public/_redirects`:**
```
/api/* /api/:splat 200
/* /index.html 200
```

This ensures proper fallback routing for client-side navigation.

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Commit and Push Changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment configuration and routing"
   git push
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to your Vercel project settings
   - Add the following environment variables:
     ```
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
     REFRESH_JWT_SECRET=your_refresh_jwt_secret_here
     JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL=3600
     JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL=604800
     DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
     DIRECT_URL=your_direct_database_url_here
     PORT=4001
     ```

3. **Redeploy:**
   - Trigger a new deployment in Vercel dashboard
   - Or push a new commit to trigger automatic deployment

## Expected Build Process

After these fixes, your build should:
1. Install dependencies for root, backend, and frontend
2. Build the backend (NestJS) with Prisma migrations
3. Build the frontend (React/Vite) 
4. Deploy both as serverless functions (backend) and static assets (frontend)

## Testing After Deployment

1. Visit your Vercel URL - should show the homepage
2. Test navigation between routes (should work without 404s)
3. Test API endpoints at `/api/*` 
4. Test authentication flow
5. Test all CRUD operations

## Common Vercel Deployment Patterns

Your configuration now follows Vercel best practices:
- Separate builds for frontend and backend
- Proper SPA routing fallback
- Serverless function for API
- Static assets for frontend

The key insight is that Vercel needs explicit routing rules to handle React Router's client-side routing, and the build configuration must match the project structure.
